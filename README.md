# go-stupidqlite
A really dumb sqlite query generator library

Sweet jesus, don't use this for anything important. It's just a utility lib for hacking together simple SQLite queries. 
It's not even vaguely complete. The purpose of stupidqlite is to throw together the SQL for an sqlite query that can
then be extended, usually via a switch or if/else block to address slightly varying queries based on context. At some
point I might add some examples but this is some 0.01 version code at the moment and it's mostly for my own amusement.
